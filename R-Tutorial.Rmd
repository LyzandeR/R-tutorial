## History of R

R is a programming language that was created for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU
project and it is considered to be a different implementation of the S programming language which
was created by John Chambers. 

R was developed by Robert Genteleman and Ross Ihaka and it was named after their first names and as 
a play on the name S. The initial version was realeased in 1995. Nowadays, R is developed and 
maintained by the R Core team, member of which is John Chambers. 


## GNU Project {.smaller}

<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="pics/RS.jpg" height="400px" width="350px"/>

The GNU project was announced on 27 Sept 1983 by Richard Stallman at MIT. It is a free software,
mass collaboration project, aimed to give users the freedom to use software with the following
rights:

- Run software
- Share software (copy, distribute)
- study 
- modify

And therefore free software was created (free to imply freedom).

## Presentation Structure

This presentation follows the structure of the book "Advanced-R" by Hadley Wickham. If you want
to dive into deep waters with R, the book is highly recommented. 

The book is available for free at [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/).

Subsetting
</div>

## Subsetting {.build}

How many functions do you know?

> - [
> - [[
> - $
> - subset <-- evil function

## [ function - 1 Dimension DS 

```{R}
#1 Dimension - use only for atomic vectors or factors
#1:5 is an atomic vector (of type integer) containing numbers 1 to 5
#letters is a built-in dataset containing all the lower case latin letters
#subsetting letters returning the first 5 letters
letters[1:5]

#same for factors
factor(letters)[1:5]
```

## [ function - 2 Dimensions DS p.1 {.build}

```{R}
#use it for matrices
mymat <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)

#what do you think?
mymat[1:2]

#but
mymat[, 1:2]
```

## [ function - 2 Dimensions DS p.2 {.build}

```{R}
#use it for data.frames
mydat <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)

#what do you think?
mydat[1]

#but
mydat[, 1]
```

## [ function - 2 Dimensions DS p.2 {.build}

```{R}
#also
mydat[3, 2]

#and 
mydat[, 1:2]

```

## [[ function - Use for lists {.build}

Can be used for 1 element.

```{R}
mylist <- list(abc = 'a', adb = 1, ba = c(1, 2))

#get first element
mylist[[1]]

#can also chain
mylist[[3]][1]
```

## $ function - Same as [[ {.smaller .build}

The `$` function is the same sas `[[`.

Quoting from ?\`$\`:

Both `[[` and `$` select a single element of the list. The main difference is that `$` does not 
allow computed indices, whereas `[[` does. `x$name` is equivalent to `x[["name", exact = FALSE]]`.

```{R}
mylist$abc

mylist$a

mylist$b
```

## subset function - Use with caution

`subset` is a very popular function among beginners since it uses a function with the name subset
which subconsciously makes it feel easier than using [, [[ and $. However, `subset` uses non-standard
evaluation which makes it extremely dangerous for using in application development.

`subset` is only meant to be used in **interactive** sessions (i.e. when working on Rstudio, Rgui 
or similar IDE).

## Chapter Summary 

Use [ for atomic vectors, factors, matrices and data.frames (at least until you feel comfortable
with what they do for each data structure).

Use [[ and $ for lists at least at the beginning. Remember that a **data.frame is in reality
a list of lists**!

Try not to use `subset` in general.

to perform various actions in R. Mastering them takes time, but the more you use them the easier it
will become!

## Chapter 4

<div class=chapter style='font-size:70px;margin-top:150px'>
Functions
</div>

## Functions

R in its core is a functional programming language, so solid foundation of how functions work is 
essential when working with R.

John Chambers has said:

"To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:

- Everything that exists is an object.
- Everything that happens is a function call."

## Function Components {.smaller}

- the `body()` - the code inside the function.
- the `formals()` - the list of arguments which controls how you can call the function.
- the `environment()`  the "map" of the location of the function's variables.

```{R}
#function double
#functions return the last evaluated object
#without needing to explicitly use return
double <- function(x) x * 2
body(double)
formals(double)
environment(double)
```

##Lexical scoping {.smaller}

Scoping is the set of rules that govern how R looks up the value of a symbol. In the example below, 
scoping is the set of rules that R applies to go from the symbol x to its value 10:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
x <- 10
x
# [1] 10
```

Lexical scoping looks up symbol values based on how functions were nested when they were created, not how they are nested when they are called. With lexical scoping, you don't need to know how the function is called to figure out where the value of a variable will be looked up.

## Lexical Scoping - Principles

There are four basic principles behind R's implementation of lexical scoping:

- name masking
- functions vs. variables
- a fresh start
- dynamic lookup

## Name Masking {.smaller .build}

```{R}
f <- function() {
  x <- 1
  y <- 2
  c(x, y)
}
f()
```

If a name isn't defined inside a function, R will look one level up.

```{R}
x <- 2
g <- function() {
  y <- 1
  c(x, y)
}
g()
```

## Name Masking - Exercise {.build}

```{R}
x <- 1
h <- function() {
  y <- 2
  i <- function() {
    z <- 3
    c(x, y, z)
  }
  i()
}
h()
```

## functions vs. variables {.build}

The same principles apply regardless of the type of associated value - finding functions works exactly the same way as finding variables:

```{R}
l <- function(x) x + 1
m <- function() {
  l <- function(x) x * 2
  l(10)
}
m()
```

## A fresh start {.build}

```{R}
j <- function() {
  if (!exists("a")) {
    a <- 1
  } else {
    a <- a + 1
  }
  print(a)
}
j()
j()
```

## Dynamic Lookup {.smaller .build}

R looks for values when the function is run, not when it's created. This means that the output of a 
function can be different depending on objects outside its environment:

```{R}
f <- function() x
x <- 15
f()

x <- 20
f()
```

## Chapter Summary {.smaller}

R is a functional Programming language in its core.

Function components:

- body
- formals
- environment

Lexical Scoping Principals

- Name masking
- Functions vs Variables
- A fresh start
- Dynamic lookup

## Chapter 5

<div class=chapter style='font-size:70px;margin-top:150px'>
Important Functions
</div>

## Flow Control {.smaller}

```{R, eval = FALSE}
#simple case
if (5 > 1) print('This is TRUE')

#two cases
a <- 5
if (a == 5) print(1) else print(2)
a <- 1
if (a == 5) print(1) else print(2)

#3+ cases
if (a == 5) {
  print(1)
} else if (a == 3) {
  print(2)
} else {
  print(3)
}
```

## Flow Control {.build}

`if` is only used for 1-length vectors. The function is not vectorised i.e. does not work on 
vectors. For a vectorised version of `if` (e.g. when you want to apply an operation on a data.frame
column) use the vectorised function `ifelse`

```{R}
if (1:5 > 3) TRUE else FALSE

ifelse(1:5 > 3, TRUE, FALSE)
```

## Loops {.smaller}

```{R}
#for-loop
for (i in 1:4) {
  print(i)
}

#while loop
a <- 1
while (a < 5) {
  print(1)
  a <- a + 1
}
```


## Loops - break and next {.build .smaller}

```{R}
for (i in 1:5) {
  if (i == 3L) break
  print(i)
}

for (i in 1:5) {
  if (i == 3L) next
  print(i)
}

```

## apply family - apply p.1 {.build}

`apply` is a base-R implementation of a for-loop.

```{R}
#it converts the object into a matrix 
df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = 6:10, c = 11:15)

#row wise operation
apply(df, 1, sum)
```

## apply family - apply p.2 {.build}

```{R}
#column wise operation
apply(df, 2, sum)

#cell operation
apply(df, 1:2, double)
```

## apply family - lapply and sapply {.smaller}

These are C implemented for-loops and therefore very efficient

```{R}
#lapply performs a column wise operation only
lapply(df, sum)

#sapply is the same as lapply but it simplifies i.e.
#converts the list into an atomic vector
sapply(df, sum)
```

## apply family - vapply 

`vapply` is my personal favourite of the apply functions. It works with vectors, it is written in C
but it also requires to tell it what the output of each iteration will be, which makes R preallocate
resources and thus make it even faster.

```{R}
#numeric(1) specifies that each iteration will output a number
vapply(1:10, double, FUN.VALUE = numeric(1))
```

## apply family - tapply {.smaller}

This is used for grouping operations

```{R}
values <- 1:6
groups <- rep(c('a', 'b'), each = 3)

#visualise groups
data.frame(values = values, groups = groups)

tapply(values, groups, sum)
```

## Anonymous functions {.smaller}

These are usually created when the function is small and since they will be used for a particular
case they don't really require a name. It is most common to see anonymous functions to be used in
conjunction with the apply family functions like `lapply`.

An anonymous function is defined in the exact same way as a named function apart from the `name <-` 
part of it (which is missing).

```{R}
#if we want to triple every value for each column of df
#then we would need an anonymous function, as this is something we will 
#just do once and there is no predefined function that does it
df <- data.frame(a = 1:10, b = 6:15, c = 1:10)

lapply(df, function(x) {
  x * 3
})
```

## Chapter Summary

We learnt about:

- for-loops
- if cases
- apply family functions

## Case Study {.smaller}

Using the `mtcars` built-in data set, do the following:

1. Write a function that will determine outliers in a vector. The function should use the IQR 
(interquartile range) method in order to identify outliers within the vector. A data point is 
considered an outlier if x is less than (25% quantile - 1.5 \* IQR ) or greater than 
(75% quantile + 1.5 \* IQR). Hint: (See `?IQR`).
2. Order the data.frame on `cyl` ascending.
3. Find the outliers of `mpg` (using the above function) in groups defined by `cyl` (imagine `cyl` 
values splitting the data.frame into three smaller ones - find the outliers in those).
4. Remove the outliers from the data.frame.
5. Get the second highest value for each one of the columns of the data.frame (after the removal
of outliers).

## Case Study Answers {.smaller}

```{R}
#save mtcars in a variable
df <- mtcars

#define the function
outlier <- function(x) {
 ifelse(x < quantile(x, 0.25) - 1.5 * IQR(x) | x > quantile(x, 0.75) + 1.5 * IQR(x), TRUE, FALSE)
}

#order
df <- df[order(df$cyl), ]

#outliers
out <- unname(unlist(tapply(df$mpg, factor(df$cyl), outlier)))

#remove outliers
df <- df[out, ]

#second highest
second_highest <- lapply(df, function(x) sort(x)[2])
```

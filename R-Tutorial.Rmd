## History of R

R is a programming language that was created for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU
project and it is considered to be a different implementation of the S programming language which
was created by John Chambers. 

R was developed by Robert Genteleman and Ross Ihaka and it was named after their first names and as 
a play on the name S. The initial version was realeased in 1995. Nowadays, R is developed and 
maintained by the R Core team, member of which is John Chambers.

The GNU project was announced on 27 Sept 1983 by Richard Stallman at MIT. It is a free software,
mass collaboration project, aimed to give users the freedom to use software with the following
rights:

- Run software
- Share software (copy, distribute)
- study 
- modify

And therefore free software was created (free to imply freedom).
